# ia-tableau-extension
Upgrade Analyst Cognition by integrating Tableau with XR incl. HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap, touchscreen devices including iOS

This is our Immersion Analytics public submission to the 2021 Tableau DATAdev Hackathon.

Important: This is the code for our Tableau Dashboard Extension. It is hosted publicly at https://airvr.studio/ia/tableau-ext/
BUT it relies on the Immersion Analytics Runtime for Hololens, Oculus, Magic Leap, or iOS/Android.
