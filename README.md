# Immersion Analytics Tableau Dashboard Extension
Upgrade Data Analyst Cognition by integrating Tableau with XR incl. HoloLens 2, Oculus, and touchscreen devices including iOS. We allow any Tableau user to take their existing Tableau Dashboard and – in a matter of minutes – have it be visualized, analyzed, and communicated immersively.

This is our public submission to the 2021 Tableau DATAdev Hackathon.

# Important
This extension is hosted publicly at https://airvr.studio/ia/tableau-ext/
BUT it relies on the Immersion Analytics Runtime for Hololens, Oculus, Magic Leap, or iOS/Android.
