# ia-tableau-extension
Upgrade Data Analyst Cognition by integrating Tableau with XR incl. HoloLens 2, Oculus, Magic Leap, and, touchscreen devices including iOS. We allow any Tableau user at any level of expertise to take their existing dashboard in Tableau â€“ and in a matter of minutes have it be visualized, analyzed, and communicated immersively.

This is our public submission to the 2021 Tableau DATAdev Hackathon.

Important: This is the repository for our Tableau Dashboard Extension. It is hosted publicly at https://airvr.studio/ia/tableau-ext/
BUT it relies on the Immersion Analytics Runtime for Hololens, Oculus, Magic Leap, or iOS/Android.
